# Zac Allen Resume

So far I have completed two of four milestone projects, User- Centric Frontend Development utilising HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap4, and Interactive Frontend Development utilising HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4, JavaScript and jQuery in which I achieved 82% and 85% respectively.

## Projects

### Zac Allen Photography
My first milestone project under the Code Institute banner. Using only HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap, a fully responsive gallery site was created.
<br>
Note: Form and links to facebook, twitter etc.. are not active in this site as it was purely a User-Centric Frontend design.

### SouthPaw Comedy
Milestone Project 2.
<br>
Using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery and Google Maps API I created a fully responsive and interactive site that allowed users to select their location from either Cork, Limerick or Dublin, upon selecting their location, Google MAps would show the recommended Comedy Clubs in that area, along with a personalised blog about each.

### Share a Script
Milestone Project 3, and my most recent work.
<br>
Utilising HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Python, Flask Frameworks, MongoDB and Bcrypt, I created a fully responsive site where authors, can create an account/login, and share their work with the world. Initially, to populate the site, famous pieces of literature were used, and these will be removed once authors begin to fill the site with their own work.
